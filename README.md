my graduation project
I would like to share a project that I developed using Java. This project is a system that tracks user usage such as minutes, data, and SMS and processes them in real-time, making it appear as if the usage is being mockingly generated.

In the project, I utilized Kafka in the client-side for generating data and instantly saved the data to a database. Additionally, I developed the API using Spring and Swagger, leveraging the repository pattern.

Lastly, I used Android Studio to create a front-end where users can log in with their phone numbers and passwords or register new accounts to view their usage details. The front-end provides a user-friendly interface for users to access and monitor their usage.

Throughout this project, I deepened my Java skills and combined different technologies to build a comprehensive application. Enabling users to track their real-time usage data is a significant achievement for me.
